How do I exit `vi`? It was a very popular question like a decade ago.

So, if you are in `vi` type `i` to enter the **insert mode** if you want to edit something.  
To leave the **insert mode** and return to the **command mode** press `ESC`.  
In the **command mode**:
- to exit type `:q`
- to save changes and exit type `:wq`

There are many other commands and plugins and many other things to grok in `vi` but those are the most important ones
especially in case if you don't use `vi` on a regular basis and just want to make a quick fix in some config file on some
remote server somewhere.
