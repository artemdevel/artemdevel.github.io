title: Jekyll setup
---

So at the end I decided to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
I checked and tried a number of options recently including just manually created HTML pages and decided to
stick to a solution which is supported by Github.

This setup is based on this Jekyll [theme](https://github.com/andrewhwanpark/dark-poole)
and I stripped it even more. No plugins. No tracking any sort. No feeds. Just plain HTML, CSS and Markdown. 

The main purpose of all of this is just keep my dev notes on anything.
